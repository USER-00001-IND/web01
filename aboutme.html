    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Your Name</strong>, a dedicated and detail-oriented web developer with a strong focus on creating clean, responsive, and user-centric digital experiences.</p>

    <p>I specialize in front-end development using technologies such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and frameworks like <strong>React</strong>. With a solid understanding of modern web standards and best practices, I build interfaces that are not only functional but also visually refined.</p>

    <p>Over the past few years, I've worked on a range of projects — from personal websites and small business landing pages to full-scale web applications — often collaborating with designers and backend developers to bring ideas to life.</p>

    <p>Beyond coding, I have a strong appreciation for good design and usability, ensuring that every product I build delivers a smooth and engaging user experience. I'm continuously learning and adapting, staying up-to-date with emerging technologies and industry trends.</p>

    <p>When I'm not developing, I enjoy exploring new tools, contributing to open-source projects, and finding inspiration in art, music, and technology.</p>
